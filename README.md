# CBSE_Article_NLP_Pipeline 

`This notebook has been created by Neha from IBM.`

`I recommend to read this article in the notebook. I have created a
[TextCodeBook](https://github.com/RK-Sharath/NLP/blob/master/NLP-Pipeline-Part-1.ipynb) in 
Jupyter Notebook explaining the Basic NLP Pipeline and IBM Watson Natural Understanding. The Notebook will not only give Theoretical knowledge of Concepts but also the Hands-on Practise excercise for better understanding of the concepts.`

### What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing.

Zeros and Ones is all what the computer understands. Computers are able to outperform humans in numbers and calculations and now with the advent of Machine Learning and Neural Networks, also in finding patterns in large amounts of data which humans cannot even dream of recognising and processing without any aid.

Alexaaa! "Play khalid's song `Young Dumb and Broke.`"

Siri! "Set an alarm for 5 am, I want to try to waking up early tomorrow"

Google! "Order a tub of Death by chocolate for me". I am kidding, Google assistant can't do that YET. But it can surely give you some restaurant suggestions along with contact details to choose from.

How are these assistants able to process these Natural Language sentences, if they only understand numbers? Pause reading this article, and try answering this question.

What if, somehow we convert these words into numbers :) Well, That's what NLP is about.

One of the definition on the internet, "Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the Natural Language. The Ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. Most NLP techniques rely on Machine learning and Neural Networks to derive meaning from human languages. "

This article aims at teaching you the basics of NLP step by step along with some basic coding practises in Python. And also, some surprise tools by IBM which make your extensive NLP tasks much simpler.
